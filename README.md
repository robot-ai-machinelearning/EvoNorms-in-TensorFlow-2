Presents implementations of `EvoNormB0` and `EvoNormS0` as proposed in [Evolving Normalization-Activation Layers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02967.pdf) by Liu et al. The authors showed the results with these layers tested on MobileNetV2, ResNets, and EfficientNets. However, I tried a MiniInception architecture as shown in [this blog post](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/10/28/3-ways-to-create-a-keras-model-with-tensorflow-2-0-sequential-functional-and-model-subclassing/) with the CIFAR10 dataset.

## TensorFlow version
2.2.0-rc3 (the version when I was testing the code on Colab)

## Performance comparison
